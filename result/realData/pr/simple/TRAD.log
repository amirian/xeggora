===========================================================================
Xeggora terminated with an error in the SQL Query. There are two reasons for this error:
(a) The most common reason for this is that your model is too large. In this case you will get timeout errors or 'SQLException: Incorrect key file for table' errors.
    Either your -data file contains too many entries or your -input file contains formulas with too many variables (more than 3 variables might be already critical)
    Please make your -data file much smaller (not more than 20 entries) and try again.

(b) If you still get an SQL Error (typically saying 'You have an error in your SQL syntax'), this is presumably a bug.
    Please generate a ticket at https://code.google.com/p/xeggora/issues/list and upload your MLN and data file. 
    Furthermore, please post the following error messages into the ticket:
 - Query SELECT (1  * 0.01084625) as weight, xx.varString1505, xx.a1 FROM (SELECT x1.field0 as `varString1505`, x0.field0 as `a1` FROM `Protein_typePred` x0  INNER JOIN `varString1505` x1 ) as xx
 - Message Unknown character set index for field '866' received from server.
Thank you for your help in improving Xeggora.

Xeggora terminated with an error in the SQL Query. There are two reasons for this error:
(a) The most common reason for this is that your model is too large. In this case you will get timeout errors or 'SQLException: Incorrect key file for table' errors.
    Either your -data file contains too many entries or your -input file contains formulas with too many variables (more than 3 variables might be already critical)
    Please make your -data file much smaller (not more than 20 entries) and try again.

(b) If you still get an SQL Error (typically saying 'You have an error in your SQL syntax'), this is presumably a bug.
    Please generate a ticket at https://code.google.com/p/xeggora/issues/list and upload your MLN and data file. 
    Furthermore, please post the following error messages into the ticket:
 - Query SELECT (1  * 0.0306603) as weight, xx.varString172, xx.a1 FROM (SELECT x1.field0 as `varString172`, x0.field0 as `a1` FROM `Protein_typePred` x0  INNER JOIN `varString172` x1 ) as xx
 - Message Unknown character set index for field '12297' received from server.

Xeggora terminated with an error in the SQL Query. There are two reasons for this error:
(a) The most common reason for this is that your model is too large. In this case you will get timeout errors or 'SQLException: Incorrect key file for table' errors.
    Either your -data file contains too many entries or your -input file contains formulas with too many variables (more than 3 variables might be already critical)
    Please make your -data file much smaller (not more than 20 entries) and try again.

(b) If you still get an SQL Error (typically saying 'You have an error in your SQL syntax'), this is presumably a bug.
    Please generate a ticket at https://code.google.com/p/xeggora/issues/list and upload your MLN and data file.
